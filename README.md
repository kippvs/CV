Description:
A copy of my CV and LaTeX code needed to generate it

Notes:
* Cobbled together from open access documents authored by:
  - Paul D. Gessler (https://github.com/pdgessler)
  - Theodore P. Pavlic (http://www.tedpavlic.com)
* If you find this useful and intend to use any of it, please reference the original authors of this work in your .TeX file
* Several commands are probably superfluous and remain from merging two .TeX files and making significant changes
* Offered AS IS, but I will update as I update my CV
